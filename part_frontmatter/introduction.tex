\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction} Computer Scientists at Aarhus
University tend to have a \emph{love-hate} relationship with all their
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) courses - with the only exception, that there
is no \emph{love} at all. Yet HCI can be a fascinating field, which makes it
saddening that so many students dismiss ever delving into it. A lot of these
students get in part frustrated due to the lack of a text book that is clear and
cuts to the point; all the coursebooks and other course material are drowning
the actual points they want to convey in huge blobs of superfluous information.
The following paragraph from a 400 page long textbook is a prime example of this
offence

\blockcquote[p. 435]{rogers}{\it What to evaluate ranges from low-tech
  prototypes to complete systems; a particular screen function to the whole
  workflow; and from aesthetic design to safety features. For example,
  developers of a new web browser may want to know if users find items faster
  with their product, whereas developers of an ambient display may be interested
  in whether it changes people's behaviour. Government authorities may ask if a
  computerized system for controlling traffic lights results in fewer accidents
  or if a website complies with the standards required for users with
  disabilities. Makers of a toy ask if 6-year-olds can manipulate the controls
  and whether they are engaged by its furry case, and whether the toy is safe
  for them to play with. A company that develops personal, digital music players
  may want to know if the size, color, and shape of the casings are liked by
  people from different age groups living in different countries. A software
  company may want to asses market reaction to its new homepage design.}

\noindent While the first sentence is useful and the next one arguably too, the
next 4 are completely without any purpose. If the reader had not already gotten
the point by the first example or second, they would certainly not have learned
it by the time they reached the end of this monstrosity of a paragraph.
Similarly, in the 27 pages long paper by Lim and Tenenberg \cite{lim} the same
style of writing is evident, where the reader can scan the text and reach a
conclusion two pages prior to the authors. Simultaneously several methods and
concepts are only very vaguely defined or not at all. For example a \emph{rich
  picture} is only defined in the textbook of Benyon with a mere mention to its
existence and a reference to a figure with two examples \cite[p.
51-52]{benyon14}. Furthermore the textbooks contradict eachother and themselves,
such as when Benyon claims the distinction between \emph{conceptual} and
\emph{physical} design is not clearly defined, yet he merely five lines later
states that the distinction between the two is very important \cite[p.
51]{benyon14}.

After a paragraph similar to the one quoted for being horrid, this is the last
time this book will ever indulge in being superflous and unreadable. This book
is an attempt to cut to the point and clearly define all concepts, frameworks,
and methods in the world of HCI and compare them. We hope this can make the
introduction to HCI for some students less frustrating, maybe even turn it from
an excruviating experience into a delightful one. For the same reasons this book
is divided into three parts: theory, examples, and exercises. With the theory
and examples segregated we wish to make the points and understanding of the
fundamental theory much clearer and easier to read. In the examples we provide
small, simple and concrete examples, while we also provide cases showing how the
many methods work together in a larger project. Finally with the exercises we
want to provide problems, where the theory can be applied and learned
effectively, while we also provide larger cases that are fit for use as weekly
handins. With the theory seperated into its own part, we see this book first and
foremost as a small encyclopedia of the world of HCI, yet we hope with the
examples and exercises, that we can produce a text book, which can be used in a
course of interaction design in its own right.

Every key word and concept is attempted to be categorized as one of the following
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition}: Definition of basic underlying ideas and vocabulary.

   \item \textbf{Concept}: An abstract idea and/or generalization of repeated
     human behaviour.

% TODO: Should be removed fully, since frameworks are so big, they usually get sections?
%   \item \textbf{Framework}: An abstract conceptual structure, around which a lot of methods are designed.

   \item \textbf{Method}: A process for designers to attain knowledge,
     understanding, and/or conclusions

   \item \textbf{Tool / Model}: An entity, which is by the designer created to
     directly inform the later design process. The distinction to be made from a
     \emph{method} is that a physical, visual or textbased entity is created to
     be directly used later, rather than just the conclusions.

     \item \textbf{Principle}: A rule that should and/or can be desirably followed
\end{itemize}

\noindent This book has been created as a joined group effort of the students of
Aarhus University. Thanks to everyone who has contributed with smaller or bigger
sections, corrections, feedback, proof-reading and much more.
