  \noindent \textbf{Interaction Design in a Nutshell}

  \vspace*{4pt}
  
  \noindent This is an attempt to dispose of the frustrating amount of superflous writing and vague or non-existent definitions in the universe of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) apparent in all text books of HCI. This is to be a dense, clearly defined, and small guide to interaction design, and it can both work as an encyclopedia of the HCI universe while also as the text book for a course in the subject.
